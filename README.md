## Big Sur

On this branch, nothing should be worried. Cause of this version I use @banh's EFI and I modified a little make it work well. 

What you got in this EFI? Just try it!

## Catalina

On this branch, you need know:

- Original wifi card AR9285 can be worked in Catalina, but you need find a way to make that, I'm not do it!
- Touchpad just have basic function like move, multi finger gestures are all not work, no fix.

## Mojave
